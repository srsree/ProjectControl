ProjectControl
==============

A application to manage projects in a medium sized IT business. The aim of the project is to create a flexible tool to monitor and deliver projects.

While already available project management tools allow this to be done at good length, we find them falling short of the needs in various ways.

This is an attempt to build some thing that:
  Works from single project senario to 100+ projects
  Works with multiple roles that can be added at run time
  Works with reasonable automation of monitoring system even with the addition of new projects
  Helps organisation's finance team manage the project cost and help smaller organisatons evolve their project management skills as they grow
  
  
Its being built on Django, a Python based application framework. This should enable deployment locally with in org and on the cloud.
